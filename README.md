## Quick Start

This section guides you through a fast path to try Hunyuan-7B on a compatible machine. The path assumes you will download a release asset from the official Releases page.

- Download and run from Releases: From the Releases page, download the release asset that matches your platform, extract it, and execute the provided runner. The asset contains the model weights, runtime, and example scripts. For the release page, visit the link below to locate the proper asset, then run the executable or installer as described in the asset’s README.
- Run a quick sanity test: After you obtain the release asset, run a minimal inference to confirm the setup works. You should see a short prompt being processed and a coherent response returned by the model.

The official Releases page contains all the binaries and setup scripts you need. For direct access to the assets and to ensure you have the latest files, open the page and pick the suitable artifact. You can reuse the same link for reference in your workflow as needed.

- Techniques:
  - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
  - Adapters for modular task specialization
  - Prompt tuning and instruction prompts for quick domain adaptation
- Data considerations: Domain-specific data should be curated to reflect real user needs and safety standards
- Evaluation: Validate fine-tuned models with task-specific benchmarks and human evaluation

Practical steps:

## Evaluation and Benchmarks

- Benchmarks cover general reasoning, coding, summarization, and multilingual understanding
- Metrics often include perplexity, accuracy on standard benchmarks, and human evaluation scores
- Baselines: Compare against established models to gauge improvements in your target tasks
- Reproducibility: Use stable prompts and consistent evaluation scripts to ensure reproducible results

If you want to reproduce a test scenario, start with a fixed prompt set and a controlled evaluation environment. Compare results across iterations to observe improvements or regressions.
